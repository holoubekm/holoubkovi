# Who are you? {#who-are-you}
Our friends, family, and simply people with whom we want to spend time. We as a group share an interest in the world, humor, and the desire to have fun. Around you will be a lot of other great people with interesting topics and stories to tell.

# Who are we? üë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüë® {#who-are-we}

Hello! We are a lad and a girl who decided that they want to be together, forever... or at least until the first big fight üòÖ. We would be very happy if you were there with us.

## Dominika

{{< image classes="fancybox right fig-50" src="i-am-freezing.jpeg" title="Hello, here is Dominika. An elegant lady, occasional baker, lover of everything growing, who doesn't like intrusive winter!" >}}

Dominika has been casting charms since childhood, first she learned to read by herself and then settled in the world of Harry Potter ‚ö°Ô∏è. Even a bilingual French grammar school did not prevent her from fulfilling her dreams. She continued her studies at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics in the field of Theoretical Physics. If you want to make her happy, you can ask her about binary stars and how it is possible that they don't bump into each other after a few spins.

Lately, Dominika is becoming a passionate cross-country runner, a responsible driver, and also a data analyst. If you want to compete, she will be happy to see you at the September run in Kl√°novice.

Domi bakes and cooks wonderfully, appreciates a book and glass of white wine. But most of all, she loves her stuffed animals, flowers, and sometimes Martas (when he's not naughty).

## Mar≈•as

{{< image classes="fancybox left fig-50" src="smiling-creature.jpeg" title="Laughing creature!" >}}

Mart√≠nek was a very curious and energetic child from a very young age, as evidenced by the pile of encyclopedias in his childhood bedroom and the many amusing stories about more or less (un)safe experiments carried out in his great-grandfather's workshop. If you ask him, he will surely be happy to tell you a story or two.

His fate was sealed on Christmas 2002, when he and his brother unwrapped their first ever desktop computer from under the Christmas tree. Playing Age of Mythology, Pharaoh and GTA awakened a desire to understand how it all worked inside. This led Mar≈•as to study at the Faculty of Information Technology at CTU, where he focused on computer science and security.

Mar≈•as' passion for technology persists to this day, but there is so much more that describes him. The unquenchable sense of humour that has charmed many of us, the inexhaustible energy of two that he likes to use for swimming, cycling or running, the ability to quote The Simpsons in any situation, or the endless patience that is shown, for example, when Dominika brings home yet another plant. All this and much more.

## We

It was a freezing evening in January 2021, I was sitting in the tea room at The Golden Rooster. While I was waiting for my date to arrive I had extra time to contemplate.

"What will she be like? What will she look like? Won't I feel a bit stupid in front of a math-physics girl from Slovakia?"

A petite girl in a fluffy hat entered the warm, scented room and smiled at me. After a while, we were both laughing and I hope we will never stop. I won't forget that Dominika lost her hat on our very first date, tripped, and then didn't know how first dates typically end. She is completely normal and that's why I love her.
