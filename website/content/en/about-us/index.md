# Who are you? {#who-are-you}
Our friends, family, and simply people with whom we want to spend time. We as a group share an interest in the world, humor, and the desire to have fun. Around you will be a lot of other great people with interesting topics and stories to tell.

# Who are we? üë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüë® {#who-are-we}

Hello! We are a lad and a girl who decided that they want to be together, forever... or at least until the first big fight üòÖ. We would be very happy if you were there with us.

## Dominika

{{< image classes="fancybox right fig-50" src="i-am-freezing.jpeg" title="Hello, here is Dominika. An elegant lady, occasional baker, lover of everything growing, who doesn't like intrusive winter!" >}}

Dominika has been charming since childhood, first she learned to read by herself and then settled in the world of Harry Potter ‚ö°Ô∏è. Even a bilingual French high school did not prevent her from fulfilling her dreams. She continued her studies at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics in the field of Theoretical Physics. If you want to make her happy, you can ask her about binary stars and how it is possible that they don't bump into each other after a few spins.

Lately, Dominika is becoming a passionate cross-country runner, a responsible driver, and also a data analyst. If you want to compete, she will be happy to see you at the September run in Kl√°novice.

Domi bakes and cooks wonderfully, appreciates a book and glass of white wine. But most of all, she loves her stuffed animals, flowers, and sometimes Martas (when he's not naughty).

## Mar≈•as

{{< image classes="fancybox left fig-50" src="smiling-creature.jpeg" title="Laughing creature!" >}}

Mar≈•as is something like a second reincarnation of Hitler.. just without a mustache. He frowns when he is hungry, otherwise he laughs childishly. He is like ants in pants.

The following text best describes him.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Donec dictum turpis vel leo ornare, eget dapibus metus ullamcorper. Morbi commodo, lacus a placerat facilisis, tellus libero lobortis augue, vitae luctus mi nunc ac sem. Suspendisse iaculis odio purus, ac aliquet erat vehicula sit amet. 

Fusce sed vehicula lacus. Nunc lobortis in tortor laoreet porta. Cras non erat felis. In aliquet lectus lorem, et elementum orci convallis eget. Suspendisse id erat tellus. 


## We

It was a freezing January 2021, I was sitting in the tea room at The Golden Rooster. While I was waiting for my date to arrive I had extra time to contemplate.

"What will she be like? What will she look like? Won't I feel a bit stupid in front of a math-physics girl from Slovakia?"

A petite girl in a fluffy hat entered the warm, scented room and smiled at me. After a while, we were both laughing and I hope we will never stop. I won't forget that Dominika lost her hat on our very first date, tripped, and then didn't know how first dates typically end. She is completely normal and that's why I love her.
