# How to get ready? {#how-to-get-ready}

# Accommodation {#accomodation}
 
**No need for accommodation, we won't go to sleep. Except for the groom, he promised to go to bed at 10.**

{{< hl-text green >}}And now seriously.{{< /hl-text >}} If you are from nearby and have the possibility to spend the night at home, with your parents, or friends, we would ask you to take advantage of this opportunity.

The Jitkovsk√Ω mill premises can accommodate about 30 people. It will be mainly occupied by the preparation and support team and also by friends from abroad.

Accommodation in Svƒõtl√° nad S√°zavou is prepared for friends from Slovakia.

If there is interest, we can prepare a tent on the meadow :))

We try to arrange with everyone individually. However, if you are not sure, do not hesitate and [let us know](../contact)!

# What is the plan for the day? {#the-day}

We are preparing a traditional ceremony, lunch, a party, including games for children and everyone!

We still don't know üôâ

# Refreshments {#menu-and-beverages}

We are preparing a flood of delicacies for you, including lunch, which will be served partly as a buffet.

Drinks and draft [Bernard](https://www.bernard.cz/) will also be ready.

# Organizational questions {#organisation}

### What to do if I can't arrive? Will you be mad?

Just a little bit :) No problem. [Just let Martin or Vojta know and that's it :))](../contact)

### I would like to bring you a wedding gift. Which one?

Thank you very much, really! But we both feel that we would like to avoid material gifts. Let's enjoy the day together, forget about the problems of the real world and switch off in the environment of the old mill.

> If you insist on some form of gift, of course, we won't frown. In that case, a small financial injection would please us :)

### Can I bring children with me?

Sure! We have prepared a children's corner, some games and fun for our little friends :)) There is nature and exhaustion all around :))
