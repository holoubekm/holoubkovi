# Accommodation {#accomodation}

**No need for accommodation, we're not going to sleep. Except for the groom, he promised to go to bed at 10.**

{{< hl-text green >}}And now seriously.{{< /hl-text >}} If you live nearby and have the possibility to stay at home, with your parents, or friends, we would appreciate if you could take advantage of that.

At the Jitkov mill, there is accommodation for around 30 people. It will be occupied primarily by the organizing and supporting team, and long-distance friends.

For the family from Slovakia, accommodation in peace and privacy is available in Svƒõtl√° nad S√°zavou for the whole weekend.

For anyone interested, we can also set up a tent on the meadow üòä

We try to arrange everything individually with everyone. However, if you're unsure, don't hesitate to [call us](../contact)!

# What's the plan for the day? {#the-day}

The most crucial point of the program - the wedding ceremony itself - is scheduled for noon. It will take place directly at the mill. If the weather is good, it will happen by the pond under a beautiful old oak tree. In case of bad weather... well, we'll see, but you certainly won't need to worry about not being able to find the ceremony location üòä We'll meet at the mill between 11:30 - 11:45, the ceremony location won't be far from the main building.

After the ceremony, congratulations and group photographs will take place. Then we'll move to the wedding table, where we'll listen to speeches and toast, and finally, (at last!) we'll feast (we tentatively estimate it to be arount 13:30). A traditional wedding soup will be served, followed by everyone choosing something tasty from the lunch buffet. 

The further program is still being prepared, but you can certainly look forward to the cake cutting, bouquet tossing, first dance, and a merry band, as well as games, not only for children but also for adults. 

# Refreshments {#menu-and-beverages}

In addition to the lunch soup (traditional beef broth with dumplings), refreshments will be served buffet-style, where hopefully everyone will be able to find something tasty üòä A selection of meat and vegetarian dishes covering almost the entire range of preferences will be available. There will also be a sweet finish in the form of a wedding cake and some pastries or fruit.

If you have any food allergy, please let us know, so we could ensure safe food options also for you.

To drink, we will have carafes of water, local draft [Bernard](https://www.bernard.cz/) beer and lemonade, wine, and also some alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. A coffee machine will be available, as well as an assortment of teas.

# What to wear?

As the wedding will take place in the less formal environment of a mill, we are not requiring a strictly formal dress üòä Wear something in which you will feel comfortable and beautiful and in which you can celebrate with us perhaps even until sunrise. 

When selecting your attire, remember that both the wedding and the reception will predominantly be held outdoors, regardless of the weather conditions (don't worry, we won't get wet, roof under which to find shelter from rain will be provided). Hence, we kindly request you to bring something warm just in case it gets colder.

Also, bear in mind that the venue is mostly covered by lawns, gravel, and cobblestones. We won't blame you if you decide to leave your high heels at home üòä

# Organizational Questions {#organisation}

### What if I can't make it? Will you be upset?

Just a little üòä Really, nothing to worry about. [Just let Martin or Dominika know and it's all good üòä](../contact)

### We would like to bring you a wedding gift. What kind?

Thank you very much, really! However, we both feel that we would prefer to avoid material gifts. Let's enjoy the day together, forget about the troubles of the real world, and relax in the surroundings of the old mill and nature.

> If you insist on giving us some form of a gift, we will certainly not frown upo it. In such cases, we would appreciate a small financial contribution üòä 

### Can we bring our children?

Sure! Children are more than welcome at our wedding üòä There will be a small play-house available with a children's corner and an outdoor playground, and the vast grounds are perfect for lengthy wanderings and exploration.
